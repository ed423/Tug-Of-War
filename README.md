# Tug-Of-War
HTML5 Canvas Tug Of War game

## A simple game concept that I made, taking inspiration from the Tug-Of-War game in the Korean drama Squid Game. My main goal in creating this project was to learn the basics of HTML5 Canvas, as well as basic JavaScript.

I originally wanted to create a Tug-Of-War game, where viewers on a YouTube live stream chat could control the player model on screen. This idea would create a sense of similarity to the game in Squid Game. 

### The finished product would involve:
* Splitting the viewers on the YouTube live stream into two teams
* Chat commands would enable users to move the player model a certain amount left or right, for example, each time the string "x" is sent in the live chat, the player model would move ten pixels to the right
* The team that moves their block to their "goal", or a rectangle on either the left or right side of the canvas, would win that particular round
* A score tracker to keep track of individual users' scores, with teams being scrambled after every round
